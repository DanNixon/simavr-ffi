# simavr-ffi

Bindings to [simavr](https://github.com/buserror/simavr).

Status: work in progress, pretty alpha, not yet released.

## Requirements

- clang (with `LIBCLANG_PATH` set),
- libelf,
- pkg-config.

### FAQ

#### Why not `simavr-sys`?

[`simavr-sys`](https://github.com/dylanmckay/simavr-sim) seems unmaintained at
the moment, hence this project.
